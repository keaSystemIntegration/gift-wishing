Bad practices on purpose in order to learn integration.

-------

During this project, one of the most important aspects that we learned was how to create a deployed server for an application using microservices architecture. The process was quite time consuming and brought us a few challenges in terms of communication and developer experience.

We had constant internal meetings where we discussed from the architecture of the system until some minor implementation details between each service. Our coordination with the other team has been generally efficient, being able to establish and follow realistic deadlines and having a good communicate in case of any doubts in terms of integration.

When it comes to developer experience, I could mention that it was a good balance between the knowledge that we had already and the things that we had to learn in order to implement the whole system. This way, we were able to use our knowledge to setup the project, but we also had the opportunity to research and create functionalities using new technologies and integrate them into our system.

One aspect that went different from what I expected was the communication between our groups in terms of integration where I thought we will have more meetings to help each other to integrate specific features each team developed. In the end, this was not necessary because of the  documentation that has been given to us which helped us to understand how the API works.
